​Professional Portfolio
## Description
​
The HTML and CSS files are created for the user(a potential employer) to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples.

I used html and css to creat a page to showcase my progressing work. I added elements and attributes that correspond with the work. I also made sure to make this user friendly with navigation tools. I also added a link to my first project.

## Usage
​
This is a user friendly files. I have sections describing ways to contact me, my work, and about me. On the top of the page I have links to help navigate through the page to the various sections of the page.
